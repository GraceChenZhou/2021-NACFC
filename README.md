# Abstract
## Background
The introduction of Highly Effective Modulator Therapy (HEMT) over the past decade continues to dramatically improve lung function trends in nearly 90% of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients in US. Though lung function gains are welcome, the predictive accuracy of lung function decline model for post-HEMT era, is unknown; particularly of interest has been identification and prediction of pulmonary exacerbation events.

## Method
We applied a non-stationary stochastic process model to predict age-related rapid lung function decline, defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second of percentage of predicted (FEV1), and adapted its corresponding predictive probability function to identify occurrence of FEV1-indicated exacerbation score (FIES) events, based on registry data for 867 ivacaftor treated patients aged 6-72 between observed period 2003 and 2018. Covariates included were splines, age, genotype, sex, birth cohort, time since baseline (ivacaftor initiation), baseline FEV1, baseline age, enzyme use, microbiology (infection with MRSA or pa), CFRD , insurance status, numbers of acute PEs and outpatient visits within the prior year. Aims of two models were implemented: i) pre- and post-HEMT (a change point was included as M1); ii) modulator impact (a modulator indicator was added as M2). Covariates were selected by the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Model fit was assessed using AIC /BIC  and model performance was evaluated via predictive accuracy metrics and calibrated through k-fold cross-validation. 

## Results
Both the change point and modulator indicator yielded significant impacts, M1 was selected as the optimal model with less AIC/BIC (LRT statistic: 783.1296, p-val<0.0001). Specifically, a post-HEMT was associated with 19.93% predicted/year less rapid decline against age . Our model was capable to capture heterogeneous nature of FEV1 declines with root mean squared error 7.43% predicted and to provide reasonable predictive probabilities of FIES with ROC  estimates 0.83 (0.82, 0.83) and accuracy rate 80% for post-HEMT.  

## Conclusions
The proposed model demonstrated robust predictions, especially for post-HEMT. As a result, it could be further implemented as a point-of-care tool for real-time predictions to the individual CF patient.
